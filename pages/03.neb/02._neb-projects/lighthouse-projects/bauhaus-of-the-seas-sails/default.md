Situated at the crossroads between art, culture, inclusion, citizenship, science and technology, the Bauhaus of the Seas Sails consortium and project brings the European Green Deal to our coastal areas by calling for a collective effort to imagine and build a sustainable, inclusive, and beautiful future. 

===

The Bauhaus of the Seas Sails intends to promote the design of complex interactions between human and more-than-human agents. It does so by reconceptualising the agenda of design, moving its drivers from fixing to caring, growth to nurture, certainty to contingency. It enables designers, architects and engineers to think about assemblages instead of systems and to change the outcome of design from extinction to precarious flourishing. The design of these interactions generates the emergence of a new aesthetics and, most decisively, a critical awareness of designâ€™s history, contemporary practice and future possibilities. Ultimately claiming designing beyond humans as a way to sustain our future.
