The New European Bauhaus (NEB) is a creative and interdisciplinary initiative that connects the [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) to our living spaces and experiences. NEB supports through various EU programmes and national initiatives a broad range of projects, prizes and partnerships that are categorised below. You can also consult the [NEB Projects Dashbord](https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/about/dashboard_en) for information at country level.
