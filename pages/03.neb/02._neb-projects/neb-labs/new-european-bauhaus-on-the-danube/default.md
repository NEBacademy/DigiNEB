The NEW EUROPEAN BAUHAUS investigates how to seriously support and drive resilient development in Danube territories. The lab brings together a transdisciplinary pool of decision makers, urbanists, artists and activists, business leaders, finance experts, academics and NGOs from the region. Together we want to achieve tangible results.

Our cities were built in response to yesterday's questions. A robust vision of the future, post-fossil, with short distances, balanced urban-rural relationships and responsible land use cannot result from established solutions alone.

The lab builds on three years of intensive non-for-profit work of the NEW EUROPEAN BAUHAUS on the DANUBE initiative. It is co-hosted by NONA, a project funded by the Interreg Danube Transnational Program.
