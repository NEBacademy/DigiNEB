The  community led NEB Stewardship Lab seeks to enhance and clarify the role of higher education to support the needed societal transition. The project will further co-develop the model of NEB Stewardship, which combines the NEB values to three stewardship dimensions: knowledge, agency and care. This combination draws the attention to capacities needed for effective individual and collective actions pursuing sustainability. At the same time, the NEB values describe the aspired characteristics of both the development process and its outcomes.

The NEB Stewardship Lab is a joint effort of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (Finland), University of Turin (Italy), IADE - Universidade Europeia (Portugal), NABA - Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti (Italy), Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Netherlands), Cyprus Institute (Cyprus) and Green Growth Generation (Italy). The group of coordinators stands behind the common goal of nurturing the transition from climate anxiety to NEB stewardship and thus, motivating for actions that contribute to positive change.
