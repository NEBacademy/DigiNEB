EIT Community NEB partners scale-up Citizen Engagement Activities (now called Connect NEB) and Co-creation of public space (now called Co-create NEB) projects implemented in the previous Business Plan 2021-22 aligned with the New European Bauhaus initiative.

**Enhance NEB**

The Enhance NEB Call offers pathways for EIT Community NEB partners to expand and grow and boost their collaboration with former Connect NEB and Co-Create NEB projects while opening them up to new partners to ensure project scaling or replication. It aims to strengthen the former Connect NEB and Co-Create NEB activities by scaling them up within their existing location or replicating their innovations elsewhere.
