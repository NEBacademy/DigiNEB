InnovaWood is an umbrella organisation that integrates four European networks in the Forest, Wood-based and Furniture industries into a more effective mechanism to support innovation in these sectors. InnovaWood has 60+ member organisations in 28 European countries, including Research and Technology organisations (RTO), higher education and VET institutions which are all related to the forest-based sector.

InnovaWoodâ€™s mission is to foster innovation and bring business benefit to the entire value chain from forestry to wood, to furniture and construction. By providing a forum to our member organisations, we enable them to contribute more effectively to the development of the sector. InnovaWood provides a European platform for its members and connected actors to share knowledge and latest information, create synergies, and follow current and future developments and innovative trends, providing strategic orientation in the European research and innovation ecosystem which is evolving in response to the global challenges.
