Her expertise lies in smart cities with a particular focus on citizens' participation. Liliana's passion has led her to explore several fields such as education, technology, business, and communities.

Through her work as an innovation coach, Liliana is making a significant impact on societal transformation and digital innovation.

One of the initiatives, Carrillo is involved in is CollectiveUp, a digital platform that offers an innovative approach to community engagement and co-creation. Through its collaborative and participatory tools, CollectiveUp helps communities and organisations to collectively design and implement more sustainable urban environments. By leveraging the power of digitalisation, CollectiveUp enables citizens to provide their input and feedback on various topics such as mobility, energy, and green spaces, and work alongside local authorities and businesses to co-create solutions that meet their needs and improve their quality of life. This approach not only promotes more sustainable practices and behaviors but also fosters a sense of co-responsibility and ownership of the environment, ultimately leading to more resilient and thriving communities.
