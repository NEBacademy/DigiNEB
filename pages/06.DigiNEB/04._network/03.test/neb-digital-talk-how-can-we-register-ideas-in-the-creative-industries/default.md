In an increasingly globalised world, broadening the scientific landscape of regionally and nationally governed blockchain networks is essential to ensure the creation and protection of creative and cultural environments. In this context, the bloxberg company has developed a secure scientific global blockchain established by a consortium of researchers and research organisations to provide science with decentralised services worldwide. Such a decentralised approach has resulted in an inclusive and permissioned network allowing the advancement of science and benefitting the scientific ecosystem at large.

**About the digiNEB.eu second webinar**

Intellectual Property (IP) is essential for maintaining author rights on innovative and creative ideas formulated by individuals or organisations. Well-managed intellectual property results in fair attribution and greater sharing of ideas in co-creation processes.

Given the key role played by IP in creative and cultural environments, during this one-hour webinar, the 1st one of our NEB digital talk series, experts in intellectual property for the creative and cultural environment present trusted decentralised technologies for the registration of ideas and discuss AI-assisted technologies for scanning the ideas landscape.

**Who can attend**
This webinar is open to user groups from different contexts and ways of life. These include architects, designers, engineers, and industry players belonging to the NEB community, including all Green Deal-related audiences interested in learning more about intellectual property management for the creative and cultural environment.
