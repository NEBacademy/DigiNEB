The Unlocking the power of innovative learning tools for bionic transformation event marks the end of the Erasmus+ GIST project by presenting the online learning course Facilitator for Bionic Transformation.

===

The course is designed for companies seeking to keep up with the increasing demands of technological transformation â€“ a challenging task for organisations requiring personnel with the skills they may not have. Companies that understand how to lead a bionic transformation can make rapid progress and create substantial value.

At the online event, you will learn from the key speakers several interesting digital tools that can support wood/furniture and construction companies in strengthening those key skills and achieving the basic competencies to reach the status of a bionic company.
Moreover, you will learn the key building blocks of a bionic company and how to become one.
