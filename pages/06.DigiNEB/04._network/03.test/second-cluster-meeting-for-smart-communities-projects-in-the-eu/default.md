The Second Cluster Meeting for Smart Communities Projects in the EU" aims to build on the first cluster meeting in June 2022 and further promote and revisit the existing cooperation between relevant smart communities projects funded by the EU and relevant EU initiatives across sectors.

This meeting represents an opportunity for projects and initiatives to look for synergies and cooperation to further advance on the road to data sharing and data services to build the smart cities and communities of the future. The Commission is taking the initiative to invite relevant and interested project leaders to have a dialogue on:

Take stock and re-visit synergies and links between websites and interactive platforms that are either specifically targeted to or have a strong component on the digital transformation at the local or regional level.
Update on collective EU efforts on interoperability and standardisation, focusing on MIMs+.
Share data and data sets to build the Data Space for Smart and Sustainable Cities and Communities.
digiNEB.eu, is one of the invited projects to join this strategic event to showcase the main assets of the digital ecosystem of the New European Bauhaus and collaborate with other like-minded projects and initiatives working towards building smart cities and communities in the EU.
