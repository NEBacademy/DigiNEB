The potential climate benefits of using more nature-based materials, such as wood and other biomaterials, in the built environment are immense and offer solutions based on available technology. Long-life, circular products can drastically diminish the carbon emissions of the building stock in Europe. Nature-based solutions will thus be key to contributing to a more resilient, self-sufficient European bioeconomy.

#### Building the bioeconomy with nature-based materials and solutions within the New European Bauhaus
InnovaWood, one of the digiNEB.eu project partners organised the EU Biodiversity Conference side event "Building the bioeconomy with nature-based materials and solutions within the New European Bauhaus" on 7 October 2022. The event showcases the next steps for the New European Bauhaus and the European Commission in the policy context.

Esteemed experts from the wood and biomaterials sectors are going to present the New European Bauhaus initiative and demonstrate how renewable and nature-based materials can contribute to decarbonising the building sector. The discussions are followed by a panel discussion highlighting the policy measures needed to make Europe greener and more sustainable.

The event is hosted by the Wood4Bauhaus Alliance, an official partner of the New European Bauhaus, which drives this change in the building sector, supports the cocreation of innovative solutions and helps to make the transition to sustainable living a widespread, powerful movement.

The event is moderated by Uwe Kies, Secretary General at InnovaWood and digiNEB.eu partner, who is going to showcase the main objectives of the project during the event.
