===

**Event Schedule:** 11-13h. Morning Session: Practice and Research, 14-17h. Afternoon session:  Education

The event will delve into the critical importance of digital tools and solutions in advancing the skills and knowledge of professionals within the built environment. We will explore the following key questions:
* What digital tools, projects, and applications have been developed and deployed thus far?
* How do these tools and projects align with different user groups and their needs?
* Are funding opportunities aligned with the demands and context in which researchers, educators, and architects operate?
* What insights can be drawn by examining usage across different scales (large, medium, small) and considering open-source and licensing aspects?

Our goal is to foster discussions and insights during the two workshops—one in the morning, dedicated to practice and research, and another in the afternoon, focused on education. By doing so, we aim to identify existing gaps and chart potential paths forward in the digital built environment.
