Wood is an extremely versatile, beautiful natural material and can play a decisive role in decarbonising the building sector. So-called "Timber cities" can store carbon for decades or even centuries in buildings using long-life engineered wood products. Architects, designers and engineers have become increasingly interested in building with wood and other biomaterials to transform the built environment into sustainable, beautiful and inclusive living spaces for the future.

This webinar presents the state-of-the-art of digitalisation in wood construction and architecture. Digital tools and Industry 4.0 allow to better integrate the whole process from design, planning, pre-fabrication and construction. The talks will illustrate the following: 

* How digital tools enable companies to build better, faster, and more cost-effective and make wood buildings more competitive;
* How beautiful buildings are created, using resources efficiently, avoiding waste and storing carbon;
* How leading companies adopt digital transformation and facilitate better collaboration in the construction ecosystem;
* How all of this contributes to the ambitions of the New European Bauhaus.

The webinar is co-organised by InnovaWood, the main EU network for wood research, innovation and education, together with the projects digiNEB.eu, Basajaun and the Wood4Bauhaus Alliance.
