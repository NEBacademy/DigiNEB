**DigiNEB provides a comprehensive overview of tools, projects, e-learning options, and open licenses relevant to the New European Bauhaus community. The innovations are presented at two different levels: separately and as part of collections.**

**The presentation of separate tools and projects makes it easy to search for them using keywords or tags. However, they are often found in collections of related tools that may present other relevant search leads. To provide you with the most complete picture possible, we offer both.**
