### [Atlas of Urban AI](https://gouai.cidob.org/atlas/)

ATLAS is a crowdsourced repository of projects happening in cities involving the use of artificial intelligence systems. It aims to recognise the efforts of automatization and digitalisation in cities, and become a focus point for researchers, local policy makers and the general public interested in AI.
