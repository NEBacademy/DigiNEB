As a teacher, she has led studios at first and third bachelor year of studies, master level studios, and mentored over 40 diploma theses some of which have been published and selected for international reviews. She has mentored extracurricular student workshops which have been covered in media, catalogues and architectural magazines.

From 2005 she has been a member of the primary Croatian scientific journal for architecture and urban planning, ‘Prostor’, has edited books in the field of architecture and been a reviewer for both scientific and professional articles and books. She was presided over the Faculty of Architecture Publishing committee between 2012 and 2016, during which time the yearbook series as well as many books and catalogues were published.

Engaging in competitions and practicing architectural design since 1999, she has won numerous awards in architectural competitions, mostly with Tonči Čerina, as well as others, and these projects have been regularly exhibited in curated exhibitions and published. She has designed in various scales, from urban design to interiors, held lectures about her work and activities, took part in art festivals and architecture events.

She has served as jury member of architectural competitions, and been a member of professional, public and faculty bodies. From 2010 she has served as the Croatian delegate of the international UIA working group Architecture & Children and has contributed to their conferences and meetings. In this capacity she was a part of the informal group ‘The Space and I’ which initiated a series of workshops and programs aimed at developing visual and spatial literacy in schools.
Since 2016 she has been serving as vice-dean of international relations and art at her Faculty, during which time she has extensively worked on involving the school in the pinnacle of relevant architectural education discussions such as those carried out within the EAAE, and initiated collaborations with European schools resulting in workshops, parallel studios and lectures. In this respect she is very keen on continuing the efforts of exploring the meaning and means of architectural education today.
