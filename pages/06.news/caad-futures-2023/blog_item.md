#### 05-07.07.2023 | TU Delft | Delft, Netherlands
***
CAAD Futures is a biannual International Conference on Computer-aided Architectural Design. The CAAD Futures Foundation plays a major global role in advancing and documenting research with its biennial Conference, in collaboration with a richly diverse community in several regionally focused groups. Over recent years, CAAD Futures took place in Los Angeles (2021), Daejeon (2019), Istanbul (2017), SÃ£o Paulo (2015), Shanghai (2013), and many more before. The first edition took place in Delft in 1985. For its 20th edition (CAAD Future 2023), the conference returns to Delft, in The Netherlands.

The 2023 conference occurs at TU Delft in The Netherlands, 5-7 July 2023.

**Interconnections: Co-computing beyond boundaries**
Architectural Design grounds on interconnections across different knowledge domains and scales. Datasets are becoming an increasingly powerful resource for the scientific understanding of the current and future built environment and its interconnections. Interdisciplinary boundaries are diminished on the shared ground of data. Datasets facilitate continuity across scales, from the territorial and urban scales to the scales of building components, materials and beyond. Next to opportunities, also new questions arise: Inquiries into the implications of collecting data, the quality, validity and versioning of datasets, into ways to reuse information, measuring and mitigating bias, and capturing the impact on policies and ethical concerns are just some of the outstanding queries to be tackled jointly.

The theme is organised in three main streamlines:

* Interconnections across Knowledge Domains;
* Interconnections across Scales;
* Interconnections across Questions.

**Co-creation Presentations at CAAD Future 2023**
The digiNEB.eu project was showcased in dedicated co-creation sessions on the 5th and 6th of July as part of the CAAD Future 2023 event. TU Delft, represented by Franklin van der Hoeven, and ICF, represented by Michela Magas, actively presented the project's key outcomes to the architectural community.
