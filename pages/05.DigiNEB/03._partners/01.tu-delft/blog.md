The research and education of TU Delft's Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment (NL: Bouwkunde) covers the full spectrum of design, engineering, planning, management, and data science in the built environment.

The faculty's research and education specifically focus on improving the design and performance of buildings, districts, cities, and regions to better meet the requirements and expectations of their users and communities. From this perspective, much of its activities can be understood as applied science, appealing to the curiosity and needs of other researchers, practitioners, and the broader public alike.
