# NEB concepts

NEB Concepts features insightful conversations with leading architects, educators, and project leaders. The discussions deal with topics at the intersection of sustainability, innovation, and human-centred design. You'll hear directly from those shaping the future of urban development, cultural heritage, and community empowerment. 

NEB Concepts is modular – it allows you to 'choose your own adventure': follow the links and tags to explore themes such as climate adaptation, technology integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration – or stick with the wide-ranging thoughts of a single interviewee. 

Each short episode provides a collection of ideas and practices, projects and reflections, highlighting the transformative potential of the New European Bauhaus for a more inclusive and sustainable future.
