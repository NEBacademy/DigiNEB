Guillem Aloy is an accomplished architect and Research Fellow at UPC-ETSAB Barcelona School of Architecture. Aloy's passion for delving into the theory and history of architecture has driven him to pursue a PhD in the field. His dedication to research and exploration has earned him prestigious opportunities, including a Visiting Fellowship at École Nationale Supérieure de Architecture de Paris-Malaquais and Beuth Hochschule für Technik de Berlin in 2019.

As a member of the UPC-ETSAB research group, the Observatory of Scenic Spaces, Aloy contributes his expertise and insights to the study of theatrical environments. His outstanding contributions have been recognized through notable awards, such as the City of Palma's Research Award in 2017 and the esteemed Institut d'Estudis Catalans' Fellowship in 2018.

Aloy's involvement in the Canon project exemplifies his commitment to preserving and showcasing the history of theatre technology. The Canon is a comprehensive compilation of the most significant practices, technologies, people, places, artifacts, and buildings that have shaped the landscape of technical theatre throughout history. With a digital and paper-based catalog, each entry in the Canon is intricately linked to a timeline, enabling a dynamic and engaging exploration of European cultural heritage in theatre technology.

This groundbreaking project goes beyond education, reaching technicians, scenographers, architects involved in designing scenic spaces, researchers, cultural managers, artists, and spectators alike. By utilising modern technologies, the Canon not only serves as an educational tool but also enriches the experiences of those involved in the world of theatre.

The methodology and platform developed for Canon hold immense potential for transferability to other disciplines. Aloy's innovative approach to representing history through dynamic and engaging means opens up new possibilities for preserving and exploring cultural heritage in various fields.

Guillem Aloy's work in the Canon project and his dedication to the research and understanding of theatre technology have solidified his position as a trailblazer in the field. His contributions not only shape the future of architectural and theatrical research but also pave the way for dynamic and engaging presentations of cultural heritage across multiple disciplines.
