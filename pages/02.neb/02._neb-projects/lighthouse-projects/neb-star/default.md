With NEB-STAR, we will change the way municipalities, business, citizens and other actors work together, in order to find fair and robust solutions to our climate and social challenges.

===

Together, we work with social innovation to become climate neutral faster - in an inclusive, aesthetic and sustainable way.

NEB-STAR rethinks how we should live and live. In the project, we both test and propose how residents and other actors in society can better design, influence and carry out the municipality's plans and missions.

Concrete methods and tools are to be tested and demonstrated in Pedersgata in Stavanger city center and on business area Site 4016 on Ã…sen, where a regional business cluster for the building and construction industry is planned.

The project will show how Stavanger, in collaboration with the twin cities of Prague (Czech Republic) and Utrecht (Netherlands), can provide insightful experimentation, demonstrations, testbeds and guidance on NEB principles in urban transitions.
