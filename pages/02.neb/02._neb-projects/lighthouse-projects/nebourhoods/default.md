Creating NEBourhoods Together ensures sustainable living and working in the Munich district of Neuperlach. Together with citizens, creative people and experts, we develop ideas in and for Neuperlach.

===

We found start-ups and implement projects that improve the quality of life, make everyday living easier and contribute to climate protection. Our focus is just as much on public spaces, attractive living, energy communities and local mobility as on youth culture, nutrition, biodiversity and a circular economy. Creating NEBourhoods Together establishes a model for other European cities: beautiful, sustainable and inclusive!
