The Eyes Hearts Hands project steers the transformation of cities while considering local heritage and social context. It involves and supports residents in their green transition close to home.

===

Climate change threatens to increase people’s vulnerability, undermine economic gains, hinder social and economic development, and worsen access to essential services. As 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, cities play a key role in tackling climate change. However, many cities often lack the skills to deploy their energy and sustainability plans effectively and city managers struggle to identify the right technological solutions and to govern full-scale renovation processes.

The Eyes Hearts Hands project thus responds with an innovative methodology that embraces the New European Bauhaus (NEB) principles. It aims to bridge the worlds of art, culture, and education with science and technology. The project will also contribute to the EU Missions that have commonalities with the NEB, with both initiatives aiming to tackle major challenges in health, climate, and the environment through closer engagement with citizens and harnessing the power of research and innovation.
