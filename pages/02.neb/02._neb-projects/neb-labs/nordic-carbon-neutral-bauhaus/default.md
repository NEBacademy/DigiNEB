Nordic authorities have already established an active collaboration for preparing effective and practical policies for sustainable construction. Regular activities include Nordic stakeholder meetings and Nordic Climate Forum for Construction, held every year. Sustainability and climate action are also well embedded into the architectural policies of the Nordic countries.

Because of this strong ambition towards sustainable built and living environment as well as the rich and diverse Nordic architecture and design traditions, the Nordic countries strongly support the emergence of the New European Bauhaus. European built and living environments, and their development, are pivotal for reaching the climate goals, as well as for addressing the social and demographic challenges that are ahead of our continent.
