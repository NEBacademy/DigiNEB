Acknowledging this common geographical and cultural legacy, the NEB goes South (NEBgS) initiative emerged as a direct response to the New European Bauhaus movement launched by EC President, Ursula von der Leyen. The project was created by 6 schools of architecture from different European countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece. Born in academia, the initiative wants to actively trigger a much needed change by rethinking education curricula and inspire research-based initiatives that can contribute for a more sustainable future in the region.
