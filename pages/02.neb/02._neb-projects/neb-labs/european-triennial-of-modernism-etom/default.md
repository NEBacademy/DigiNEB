The ETOM initiative develops a co-creation platform on trans-European Modernism and organizes a decentralized triennial festival. ETOM builds on the «Triennale der Moderne» (TDM) festival in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar, which returned for its fourth edition in 2022.

The initiative was created «bottom-up» during the pandemic in 2021, and has already brought together 38 partners from 14 countries and of a heterogeneous and cross-sectoral background, including 9 official NEB partners. It was launched by the Berlin TDM curators together with partners from across Central Europe, originating from an emerging network based on partners from the 2019 trans-national «re:bauhaus» festival, as well as from DOCOMOMO, ICOMOS and the NEB community.

Following the motto «Diverse Modernism | Modern Diversity», the ETOM initiative addresses both the heritage of and the future perspectives on Modernism in terms of built heritage and the history of modern ideas, with a particular focus on the sustainability and resilience of such modern values as societal emancipation, social equality, and democratic participation.
