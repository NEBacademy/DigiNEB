HARBORS Barcelona involves children and youth in the investigation of Barcelona’s historical relationship with the Mediterranean Sea to learn about the city’s maritime heritage.

===

HARBORS Barcelona revalues the activities that have been historically associated with it and inquire into climate change consequences that are already noticeable. As the youngsters absorb the knowledge about the past and future of the Mediterranean Sea, they will have the opportunity to build their own wooden boat, which they will use to participate in a regatta on the Barcelona coast, accompanied by other boats, which will serve to corroborate what they will have learned through the collection of data and to clean the sea surface of marine debris.
