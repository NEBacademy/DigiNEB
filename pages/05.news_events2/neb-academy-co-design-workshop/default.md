To advance the development of the NEB Academy, representatives from the New European Bauhaus team and the European Commission convened on 6 and 7 March 2023 at the University of Primorska in Izola, Slovenia. During this strategic meeting, the participants collaborated to design a comprehensive structure and operating concept while also defining goals and fundamental operations.

Key members of the New European Bauhaus and digiNEB attended the event, including digiNEB.eu partners Michela Magas, Chair at ICF and NEB High-Level Round Table member, and Uwe Kies, Secretary General at InnovaWood, an industry member of the initiative.

#### What is the NEB Academy
The New European Bauhaus is a creative and interdisciplinary initiative that connects the European Green Deal to our living spaces and experiences. One of the objectives of this initiative is to establish the NEB Academy, which will provide a platform for fostering knowledge and skills related to bio-based materials, circularity and sustainability in construction.
