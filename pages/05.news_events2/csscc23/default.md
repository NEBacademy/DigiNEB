The CSSCC Conference is a unique global opportunity for cities, regions, towns, and national and international policymakers and businesses to connect to the forefront of human-centric societal development shaped by real-time connected technologies, markets and policy in the 21st century.

===

The CSSCC Conference 2023 is organised by the Open & Agile Smart Cities network (OASC), which is a focused effort – driven by cities, backed by industry – to establish a global smart city market based on simple standard mechanisms for interoperability and exchange of data, especially real-time data from connected devices since this is where the main challenges are.

The upcoming conference takes place in Brussels from 17 to 18 January and is centred around the title: "Collective Action in a Fragmenting World" and consists of a Community Day (17 January) and a Conference Day (18 January).

On the Conference Day, digiNEB.eu is joining the panel discussion "New European Bauhaus – Building a European Digital Ecosystem" on cities and communities’ digital transformation, together with the DS4SSCC and Living-in.eu projects.
