#### Why should you attend the "Digitalising NEB" event? 
The annual event of digiNEB.eu will explore the digital transformation of the New European Bauhaus (NEB). This hybrid event, set in the vibrant city of Barcelona, in the context of the Smart City Expo World Congress, will offer attendees a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives and achievements in its first year.

The day will conclude with networking opportunities and a look ahead to 2024.

The event is open to digital solution providers, adopters, research projects in the NEB and/or digital fields and anyone passionate about the digital transformation of NEB and cities.
