Contribute to the consultation initiated by the European Commissionon on defining the content of the New European Bauhaus Facility by giving feedback on the [Questionnaire on the next NEB Facility](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/NEBFacility#page0), which addresses two components: 

* the research and innovation component
* the roll-out component.
 
The questionnaire is accompanied by a scooping document outlining the NEB Facility.
