#### Transdisciplinary Synergies for a Flourishing Future: the New European Bauhaus as a Catalyst for Innovation and Change

In the context of intricate global challenges, the New European Bauhaus (NEB) presents an integrative framework to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal.

===

Emphasising sustainability, inclusivity, and aesthetics, the NEB advocates for a comprehensive, participatory, and multi-stakeholder methodology. Drawing from the NEB's principles, this workshop offers an avenue to explore strategic collaborations and innovations that can catalyse sectoral transformations. The discussion will encompass adaptive decision-making, emergent business models, and the pivotal roles of digital tools and education in facilitating change. Digital solutions provide unparalleled opportunities for knowledge dissemination and collaborative endeavours, while education acts as a catalyst, enhancing societal capacity for sustainable actions.

#### itAIS 2023 Workshop 
The workshop is structured into two distinct segments: an initial panel discussion on the aforementioned themes and a showcase of research that aligns with these topics. The overarching objective of this workshop is to facilitate a robust exchange of ideas and experiences, thereby promoting the integration of NEB principles into standard practices. This engagement transcends academic dialogue, serving as an impetus for actionable, multi-level change. digiNEB.eu will present during this workshop in a panel discussion entitled "NEB Initiatives and Projects", showcasing its catalogue of digital solutions mapping NEB-related initiatives from all across Europe.
