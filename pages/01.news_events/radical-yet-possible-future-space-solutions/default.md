The New European Bauhaus Collateral Event Radical yet possible future space solutions takes place at the 18th International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia on 25 and 26 May 2023. Following the central theme of the Biennale Architettura 2023, “Laboratory of the Future”, and in line with the mission of the New European Bauhaus, the conference constitutes a radical, intellectual and practical laboratory of the future.

#### Radical yet possible future space solutions - Main themes 
The event allows experts, students, and visitors to experiment, discover and design the future with the power of their minds.The participants will reflect on radical, yet possible human actions leading to a better use of space and resources. In particular, they will discuss new ways of living and how to go beyond the conviction that the future of humankind is bound to already existing solutions.

During the event, Michela Magas, a member of the NEB High-level roundtable and digiNEB.eu project partner will join Lab 1 entitled  "Dealing with future human behaviour - How will we learn?"
