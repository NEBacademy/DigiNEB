***
The New European Bauhaus supports a movement of sustainable communities, inclusive dialogues, and purposeful activities. The role of partners is to help build and inspire these communities. At the same time, they act as sounding boards and key interlocutors for the initiative. The call for partners of the New European Bauhaus is permanently open.
